Using regression trees, I predict the median price of houses for a specific area in USA so it can be used to make offers.

The dataset real_state.csv has information on areas/towns. The features are

CRIM: Crime per capita

ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS: Weighted distances to Ô¨Åve Boston employment centers

RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways

TAX: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000

PTRAIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town

LSTAT: Percent lower status of the population

MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

I evaluate the model accuracy and calculate the average error I make in predicting the price of houses.
